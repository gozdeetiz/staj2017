Natural Join: Guidelines
- The associated tables have one or more pairs of identically named columns.
- The columns must be the same data type.
- Donâ€™t use ON clause in a natural join.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2

select JOB_TITLE, AVG(SALARY) from hr.employees natural join hr.jobs group by JOB_TITLE
